#### 1.Why there is no any test?

A: Yea,I am really sorry about this,that's because at first I don't consider make this to a open src lib,I
plan add tests in the end.But after I write almost a week,I think it will be helpful if I put this to github.
On the other hand,I am not familiar with writing tests,so if there is any people who want to help,I will much
appreciated.

#### 2.Is there any third-party libs in this project?

Yes,IIRC,we use [react-spark-scroll](https://github.com/gilbox/react-spark-scroll) for scroll beacause I look through some libs and find that this is most
appropriate though it still has some problems.So you if have any better ideas,feel free to send a pr!And on other
hand,we use [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames),[reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect),[lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash),you can find all of them in the package.json file,these are ordinary libs
like others project.

#### 3.What does the `config.events.quietWater.prevReplyPressKey` means?

It means that you can press the `prevReplyPressKey` corresponding key of the keyboard to jump to previous reply
or next reply(by using `config.events.quietWater.nextReplyPressKey`).

#### 4.Why the file create time from 2017/1 to now?

Yea,many files are from my previous project and are applicable for many projects,so I just copy them to this
repo,I don't modify the create time because it's unnecessary.So this is why the file create time in this repo have 
a little span.

#### 5.What's the plan in the future?

We have thought about many great ideas,you can search the **TODO** keyword in the src code to get a list which we
would probably be added to React-QuietWater.And if you have any other requirement,feel free to file a issue.
