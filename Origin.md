### Motivation

Not only personal blog,websites,but also any websites around the world,many developers often want to add a comment module/area
in their apps to make it lively and active.So that's why React-QuietWater is here.

### Name origin
 
Today,a lot of people,of course including me,are **fickle and painful**.We treate others rigorously due to the blame of our superior,
the stress in our life,the atmosphere around our walk,dining and living.

So,on the web,we wantonly wreak our bad emotion to everyone,even our kinsfolk.

That's really,really too heartrending.This is **not** real me,**not** real us.

So,QuietWater means that talk with others like water which is peaceful,harmonious and loving.

### Logo origin

If you are Chinese,you will know that the Quiet-Water corresponding word is "止水".Yea,that exactly is the name of "宇智波止水"([Shisui Uchiha-うちはシスイ](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shisui_Uchiha))
in the anime([NARUTO -ナルト-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto)).So we use his [eyes](https://matome.naver.jp/odai/2142391458398577101/2142428098462853003) and combine with React logo.
